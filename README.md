#CityTradingSimulation
This is an experiment to see if I can build a graph of "cities" that "trade" with each other
##Current Goals
* create graph of "cities"
* define trade routes between cities
* cities will 
 * produce certain goods
 * consume certain goods
 * surplus goods will get cheap
 * in demand goods will get expensive
* traders will traverse graph
 * purchase goods at cities that have surpluses
 * sell goods at cities that are willing to purchase goods at a higher price than purchased
* try to find conditions that reach a steady state

##Future goals
* cities will grow in population based on consumption
* cities will shrink based on prolonged deficits
* cities should eventually die if demands can not be met
